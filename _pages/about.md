I am a second year Ph.D student in the Department of [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) working with [Prof. Ashish Goel](https://web.stanford.edu/~ashishg/) on problems related to algorithms and social choice. I completed my dual degree (B.Tech + M.tech) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. 

<!--
My research interests broadly lie in **Learning Theory, Coded Distributed Computation** and **Information Theory**. I have specifically worked on problems related to statistical inference, learning theory and gradient coding. I am primarily interested in theoretical problems in these areas and would like to apply these techniques to solve real world problems.

My master's thesis was with [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~nikhilk/) and [Prof. Lalitha Vadlamani](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~lalitha.v/) where we are exploring the problem of straggler mitigation through gradient coding. During my undergraduate years, I have worked with [Prof. Nikhil Karamchandani](http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~nikhilk/) on problems related to learning theory and statistical inference and with [Prof. Harish Pillai](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/hp) on problems related to redundancies in distributed computing. I spent my third year summer interning at Texas Instruments on delay optimisations in digital logic circuits. I was also a part of undergraduate students in [IIT Bombay Racing team](http://www.iitbracing.org) which manufactures an electric car every year and participates in the annual [Formula Student](https://www.imeche.org/events/formula-student) competition and led the design of harness and Controlled-Area-Network(CAN) communication in [EVO-K](https://www.iitbracing.org/cars/evok.php).

I am a Fifth Year Dual Degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) student of [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web) at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) with specialization in Communications and Signal Processing. My research interests broadly lie in **Applied Probability, Learning Theory, Optimization, Game Theory** and **Social Networks**. I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of problems in these fields and I also like to apply these tools to solve real world problems.

My master's thesis is with [Prof. Ankur Kulkarni](http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~ankur/) and [Prof. Jayakrishnan Nair](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~jayakrishnan.nair/), where we are exploring the topic of Games on Networks. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Vivek Borkar](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/faculty/homepage/borkar) on problems in reinforcement learning, multi-armed bandits and MCMC over graphs. I spent the Summer of 2017 as a research intern at the University of Southern California under the guidance of [Prof. Rahul Jain](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~rahuljai/Welcome.html), where we worked on a risk aware stochastic optimization problem.
